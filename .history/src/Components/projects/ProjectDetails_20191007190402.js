            In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University in Boston,
            Massachusetts, joined Allen, who was working as a programmer for
            Honeywell near Boston, to write software for the first
            microcomputers, later called PCs. They started by adapting BASIC, a
            popular programming language for large computers.
